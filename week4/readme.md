TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

I felt that this week's tasks is harder to complete than last few weeks' one. I learned that json can be used as a library function. However this is pretty much all what I could learn this week. As I felt the tasks were hard, I could not complete them even thought I have attempted on them. I am still not sure how to use json to make a dictionary. I have tried to look for some usefull information online, but I couldn't find the one which is suitable for the tasks in this week. I looked over the hangman file and IO example file, and I saw json.dump and json.load fucntions. I assumed that json.dump is used for saving the infomation to the json library and json.load for loading that saved infomation in json library. I tried to use them but I couldn't figure out the way, unfortunately. Therefore, almost everything in this week is still unclear.
