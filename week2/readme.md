TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

""" I learned more functions of python such as adding integers, making strings uppercase, combining strings and int etc. At first, conditioning functions (if, elif, else) were a bit hard to understand. But I think I understood the basic concept of it. I felt that boolean functions are useful as well since it can answer to simple questions.  

However, I am really unsure of for loops, as I could not complete the exercise 3's majority of for loops functions. I tried days to get the answers but somehow many error messages appear. So I guess I need a help in this area. """
